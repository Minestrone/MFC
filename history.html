          Swashbuckling ahead! For those who are not familiar with me I&#39;ve been involved in sword fighting (Fencing) since 2004. 
          With an equestrian background and loving the medieval era, I was always attracted to the sport. In 2003 Pirates of the 
          Caribbean was released. There were some great sword fighting scenes albeit "a la Hollywood." That was it; I was going to 
          find out how to fight like that. I found a local club and with in three lessons I knew I wanted to compete as far as I 
          could go. Several months later I had gone to my first out of club tournament all the way in Reno, Nevada. I ended up with 
          my first gold medal and my first rating in foil. I went on to learn all three weapons foil, epee and saber. In 2005 the 
          United States National Fencing Championship was going to be held in Sacramento, California. I decided I would fence in as
          many of the events possible. Most of my events would be with the Epee weapon but one would be in Sabre. Most fencers only 
          attempt one or two events but I hated the thought of wasting any opportunity to get a medal. I trained long and hard at the 
          club here, at my home, and in Davis California. I got off to a rough start but ended up being ranked 42 in the country in Veteran 
          Epee (40-49 years of age) and the surprise outcome of getting 26th out of 96th in Div Three Saber with only four months training 
          with that weapon, getting defeated by the girl who went on to win it.

          Not one to rest on my laurels, I decided I now wanted to teach. I approached C.A.R.D which
          is the local Park Recreation department here in Chico. They were receptive to the idea and
          my class began. Now a year later the class has gone thru some changes and is really starting
          to grow. We now have men, women and children down to the age of 8 years. Several of my
          students have gone to tournaments where they have been competitive and now winning their own
          medals. To see your students evolve and grow is quite rewarding.

          The community has been good to me and I decided I wanted to give something back. I planned on
          putting on my first local tournament and choose the non profit organization of Big Brothers/Big
          Sisters to be the benefactor. They have been helping out kids in our communities for a very
          long time. We choose August 19th 2006 to be the date of the first annual DARE MIGHTY THINGS
          OPEN fencing tournament. I decided after reading a quote from President Teddy Roosevelt that
          <b>"dare mighty things"</b> was going to be the motto of my club for it definitely is the motto
          for my life. The excerpt goes: &#34;Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs,
          even though checked by failure... than to rank with those timid spirits, who neither enjoy much,
          nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.&#34; I am
          very empowered by these words. It shows how we should strive beyond our comfort zone. Even though
          we may not be successful every time, you get up and try again. Part of obtaining the goal is the
          journey to reach it. The adventure makes it worth the failures we encounter along the way. Then
          when we do accomplish the task, the battle, the goal, then how sweet to know we were able to
          stretch that far and attain it, making the victory even better!

          Our second tournament was to benefit the Make a Wish Foundation right here in Butte County. 
          What a wonderful charity to help brighten the lives of seriously ill children. Our tournament 
          raised $3,500.00. On top of that the fencing was great and the tournament was gaining credibility. 
          We had fencers from Nevada and all over Northern California. We look forward to many years of putting 
          on this tournament so that the public can see great local fencing right here in the North State!
